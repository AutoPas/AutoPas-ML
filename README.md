# AutoPas-ML
ML for AutoPas

Currently there are four different implementations:
1. APML-Basic: Depends on 4 variables, classification
2. APML-Picture: Depends on picture values, classification
3. APML-Regression: Depends on 4 variables, regression
4. APML: NOT YET BUILT, combines variables with picture

Important notes:
- All notebooks have about 5 code blocks common
- Need better normalization strategies
- The structure of notebooks are confusing
